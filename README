int inMPI_DSDE_Global_WindowExchange( int nproc,
                                      int irank,
                                      MPI_Comm comm,
                                      const int *isend,
                                      int *irecv);

nproc = number of MPI ranks used
irank = current process rank
comm = a communicator (like MPI_COMM_WORLD)
isend = a pointer to an array of integer constants sized by "nproc"
irecv = a pointer to an array of integers sized by "nproc"

Each non-zero integer found in the array pointed to by isend is transmitted
to the array pointed to by irecv on the process with rank corresponding to
the position in the isend array.
